You already have a strong foundation. Below is a clear, structured list of what you are currently MISSING and MUST include to run a serious Part 135 charter-quoting platform at scale.

I’ll group this into Critical (Must-Have) and Operational (Strongly Recommended).

⸻

✅ WHAT YOU ALREADY COVER WELL

You’ve already addressed:
	•	Trip intake
	•	Aircraft & crew availability
	•	Cost components
	•	Quote generation
	•	Contract + post-flight data
	•	Compliance basics
	•	Margin tracking

This is good. Now let’s fill the dangerous gaps.

⸻

🚨 CRITICAL MISSING ITEMS (MUST INCLUDE)

If you don’t add these, your system will break legally, financially, or operationally.

⸻

1️⃣ Client & Identity Management (CRM Layer) — MISSING

You need a full client profile system.

Must Add:
	•	Client ID
	•	Company name (if corporate)
	•	Billing address
	•	Primary contact
	•	Emergency contact
	•	Nationality (for intl flights)
	•	Sanctions screening status
	•	Repeat-client history
	•	Risk flagging (late payments, disputes)

Why:

Charter brokers get burned by bad clients. This prevents that.

⸻

2️⃣ Payment & Escrow System — CRITICAL GAP

You mentioned “payment schedule” but not the infrastructure.

Must Add:
	•	Payment method (ACH, Wire, Card)
	•	Escrow/Trust account handling
	•	Deposit tracking
	•	Balance due tracking
	•	Refund processing
	•	Chargeback handling
	•	Failed payment alerts
	•	Currency conversion engine

Why:

Most charter losses happen in payments, not flying.

⸻

3️⃣ Regulatory: Part 135 Compliance Engine — MISSING CORE

You mentioned TSA/GDPR, but NOT actual 135 compliance.

Must Add:
	•	Operator Part 135 certificate verification
	•	Ops Specs tracking
	•	Insurance verification (limits + expiry)
	•	MEL status (Minimum Equipment List)
	•	Aircraft conformity status
	•	Pilot currency tracking
	•	Duty time/FDP compliance
	•	Drug/alcohol compliance logs

Why:

You can’t legally sell flights without verifying this.

⸻

4️⃣ Aircraft Technical Data Layer — MISSING

You mention “category” and “range,” but that’s insufficient.

Must Add:
	•	Tail number
	•	Performance profiles
	•	Runway length requirements
	•	Hot/high performance limits
	•	Payload/range curves
	•	Fuel burn tables
	•	De-icing capability
	•	ETOPS (if applicable)

Why:

Bad performance data = illegal dispatch.

⸻

5️⃣ Real-Time Operations Monitoring — MISSING

You only store post-flight info. You need live ops.

Must Add:
	•	Live aircraft tracking
	•	Weather monitoring
	•	NOTAM monitoring
	•	ATC delay alerts
	•	Diversion alerts
	•	Crew legality alerts
	•	Disruption management workflow

Why:

Clients expect real-time updates.

⸻

6️⃣ Risk & Liability Management — MISSING

You’re exposed without this.

Must Add:
	•	Contract risk flags
	•	High-risk destination list
	•	Political/security risk feeds
	•	Weather risk scoring
	•	Operational risk scoring
	•	Insurance claim tracking

Why:

This protects your company legally.

⸻

7️⃣ Operator Management System — MISSING

You list “operator,” but not management.

Must Add:
	•	Operator profiles
	•	Historical reliability score
	•	Cancellation rate
	•	Safety record
	•	Audit history
	•	Contract terms per operator
	•	Preferred/blacklist status

Why:

Not all operators are equal.

⸻

8️⃣ Dispatch & Scheduling Engine — MISSING CORE

You price, but who flies it?

Must Add:
	•	Crew pairing logic
	•	Duty/rest optimization
	•	Aircraft rotation planning
	•	Maintenance scheduling
	•	Hangar availability
	•	Slot coordination

Why:

Without this, you’re only a calculator.

⸻

⚠️ STRONGLY RECOMMENDED (HIGH BUSINESS VALUE)

These separate amateurs from serious platforms.

⸻

9️⃣ Contract Lifecycle Management — PARTIAL

You mention documents, but not workflow.

Add:
	•	E-signatures
	•	Contract templates
	•	Clause versioning
	•	Jurisdiction rules
	•	Dispute history
	•	Arbitration records

⸻

🔟 Dynamic Pricing & Yield Management — MISSING

You’re doing static formulas.

Must Add:
	•	Demand forecasting
	•	Market price benchmarking
	•	Load factor modeling
	•	Seasonal pricing engine
	•	Competitor monitoring
	•	Surge logic

Why:

This is how airlines make money. You should too.

⸻

1️⃣1️⃣ Broker / Affiliate Management — MISSING

You mentioned broker name only.

Add:
	•	Broker profiles
	•	Commission rules
	•	Payout automation
	•	Performance tracking
	•	Fraud detection
	•	Lead attribution

⸻

1️⃣2️⃣ Customer Experience Platform — MISSING

You log comms, but no CX system.

Add:
	•	Client portal
	•	Mobile access
	•	Push notifications
	•	Trip dashboard
	•	Loyalty tracking
	•	VIP handling rules

⸻

1️⃣3️⃣ Audit & Legal Trail — MISSING

This protects you in lawsuits.

Add:
	•	Immutable logs
	•	Quote change history
	•	Price justification logs
	•	AI decision logs
	•	Human override records
	•	Compliance audit trail

⸻

1️⃣4️⃣ AI Governance Layer — MISSING

You’re using AI → regulators will ask.

Add:
	•	AI confidence scoring
	•	Manual override tracking
	•	Bias monitoring
	•	Error reporting
	•	Training data governance
	•	Model versioning

⸻

1️⃣5️⃣ Financial Reporting System — MISSING

Margin tracking ≠ accounting.

Add:
	•	P&L per trip
	•	Revenue recognition
	•	Operator payables
	•	Tax reporting
	•	VAT/GST handling
	•	Escrow reconciliation

⸻

📌 WHAT YOU ARE MOST DANGEROUSLY MISSING (TOP 5)

If you only fix 5 things, fix these:

1. Part 135 compliance engine

2. Payment + escrow system

3. Dispatch & scheduling engine

4. Aircraft performance database

5. Operator risk management

Without these, your platform cannot scale safely.

⸻

🧠 COMPLETE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (IDEAL)

Your finished platform should look like:

1. Intake Layer (You have this)
2. CRM & Client Risk Layer ❌
3. AI Extraction Layer ✅
4. Compliance Engine ❌
5. Ops & Dispatch Engine ❌
6. Pricing & Yield Engine ⚠️
7. Payment & Escrow ❌
8. Contract Management ⚠️
9. Real-Time Ops ❌
10. Reporting & Audit ❌

Right now: You’re strong in #1 and #6, weak everywhere else.

⸻

⚙️ BUSINESS REALITY CHECK

What you’re building is not “just a website.”

It’s:

A mini-airline operations system + broker platform + fintech stack.

Companies like:
	•	Avinode
	•	JetSmarter (failed partly due to ops gaps)
	•	Victor
	•	FlyExclusive (in-house)

All invested millions into this stack.

⸻

🚀 NEXT STEP (If You Want)

If you’d like, I can next help you with:

✅ A minimum viable architecture (what to build first)
✅ A 12-month development roadmap
✅ A lean MVP version that still works legally
✅ Recommended tech stack

Just tell me which one you want.


turn this into a concrete PLAN for me five separate agents.
